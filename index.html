    <ul>
        <li><a href="javadoc/index.html">The full report is available here</a> - <i>Outputted to `javadoc` folder to reduce clutter in this main folder. `Part` class excluded, as requested in rubric.</i></li>
        <li><a href="javadoc/partsapp/windows/main/MainWindow.html#handlePartsDeleteButtonClick()">The runtime issue encountered is commented in the MainWindow class with a "Note" prefix</a> - <i>The rubric was a little vague as to where the runtime comment should be found, in the JavaDoc report or directly above the runtime error line-- I opted for this approach with a second comment above the line to further point out where it was encountered.</i></li>
        <li><a href="javadoc/partsapp/inventory/Inventory.html">A future improvement is noted in the Inventory class overall with a "TODO" comment</a> - <i>This relates to using a database backing store in the future.</i></li>
        <li><a href="javadoc/partsapp/windows/products/ProductWindow.html#validateForm()">A future improvement is noted in the ProductWindow class overall with a "TODO" comment</a> - <i>This relates to some added validation logic which could be added, based on potential requirements to discuss with a product team.</i></li>
